I have extracted two samples from the dataset and intentionally corrupted one of them to validate my approach. Fortunately, the original dataset is almost clean!
>- Check `original_dataset/sampler.py` for furthur explaination on how I sampled the data.
>- You can find the exrtacted samples in `./batchs`.
>- check CSV files I used to valdiate sets in `./unique_keys`
